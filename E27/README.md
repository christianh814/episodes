### Show Recap

We had a bit of a digression in to Irish, Gaelic, and Welsh specifically in reference to St. Patrick's day.

We introduce how to get started with Developer Sandbox.
In short, go to [https://red.ht/dev-sandbox](https://red.ht/dev-sandbox) and start clicking buttons.

We briefly discuss "making it go" and answer questions about the developer program/subscription.
Which leads to a bit of a discussion of [https://cloud.redhat.com](https://cloud.redhat.com).

We then attempt to show demo CodeReady Workspaces after struggling with the UI.
However, before we get there we talk a bit about operators, containers, and getting them in to your Developer Sandbox.
We also talk about the differences between operators and containers and why you might want to use operators.
However, we also point out that containers are available in Developer Sandbox and operators are on the wish list.

We finally get to talking about Workspaces and we attempt to load a nodejs app in to it.
We try to figure out what is wrong but apparently, we are doomed to fail today.

We try a number of things to unfail but, it doesn't happen.
Check back in a future episode for more success.

If you want to collect points for the most recent episode, find the code in the stream (link [here](#details)) and submit it at [https://red.ht/level-up-point-form](https://red.ht/level-up-point-form).
You do not need the "full" url that is displayed in the show it just makes it easier.
The code is always in the form of TLUH-XXXXXX (where "X" is a digit).
There is no deadline for the code submission (except if we stop doing points) aside from making it in the day before the next show if you want to be in the point rankings.

You will also get points for doing other things, like submitting issues and PRs on this repository.
However, those points are manually added by the admins.
If you have any questions about the points, find us on [discord](https://discord.gg/5VMVGJt) and ways [to collect them](../activities.md).
