### Show Recap

First up, we welcome Rich "[@SideAngleSide](https://twitter.com/SideAngleSide)" Jerrido and Gordon Tillmore to the show to bring some subscription experience to the show.

We open up trying to describe what the experience of using our subscription management.
Rich has a very good answer to this question by first focusing on "what is a subscription for?"
He outlines 5 "pillars."
He then discusses how he wants to surface those "pillars" in the tools you use to manage your subscriptions.
He also mentions that his new'ish team is working to make this real but it will take a while.

Langdon asks about how subscriptions are made available to developers.
Rich responds by talking about all the different use cases / types of developers.
He mentions that Red Hat is actively working on meeting the needs of a much wider variety of use cases and types of users.
One example being the new Developer Subscription.

We move on to discuss the "variables" around the types of subscription that you might want and what is available.
Examples include how/when you can call support and what binaries you can access.

We talk a bit about calling for Developer Support at Red Hat.
Specifically, that this is somewhat unusual as you rarely can call for development advice on a platform.

We transition to talk about the Level Up program and access to *free* OpenShift subscriptions.
In a related discussion, we start talking about RHCSAs and how there are lots and lots of them.

We move on to discuss a lot of new options for certifications and training.
We bring this up because there are new subscription options related to training in particular.
Gordon remembers when his team tried to give away a lease to a Corvette with a Shadowman logo.
We also talk about why "free retakes" might be a nice feature for our exams.

We move on to talk about "Subscription Watch," a new tool from Red Hat, that can give you some insights in to your subscriptions.
Rich talks about enabling our customers to spend much less energy on managing your subscriptions.
We also talk about how Subscription Watch and Red Hat Insights will be paired in the future.

We move on to discuss how, as a small number of subscriptions user, these new tools should improve your subscription experience.
Apparently, this is also an issue for large subscription environments.
As a result, for both use cases, Red Hat is increasingly improving that experience.
Rich makes some particularly good points about this around minute 56.

We touch open Sweet, Sweet Internet Points.

We then come back to types of subscriptions that we actually offer.

Rich circles back to focus on the core component.
While subscriptions are important, they shouldn't be getting in the way of our customers.
